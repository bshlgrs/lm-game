Vehicles with camouflaging capabilities.\n\nAdvances in materials science, distributed algorithms and manufacturing processes are bringing all of these things closer to reality every day, says a review published today in the journal Science by Nikolaus Correll, assistant professor of computer science, and research assistant Michael McEvoy, both of the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nThe \"robotic materials\" being developed by Correll Lab and others are often inspired by nature, Correll said.\n\n\"We looked at organisms like the cuttlefish, which change their appearance depending on their environment, and the banyan tree, which grows above-ground roots to support the increasing weight of the trunk,\" Correll said. \"We asked what it would take to engineer such systems.\"\n\nRobotic materials require tight integration between sensing, computation and actually", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-2.6184427738189697, -2.698899269104004, -2.3433830738067627], "logp_the": [-0.07571147382259369, -0.06964973360300064, -0.10092843323945999]}
