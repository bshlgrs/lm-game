The following week will begin with three days of private stakeholder meetings and then at least one public meeting for the CCC to vote on acceptance of the draft regulations.\n\n\"We really have to have our drafts done in December and to have our draft regulations done in December we literally have to have at least a full week of public meetings and discussions about some of the critical items we have to decide on,\" Hoffman said Tuesday.", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-4.979383945465088, -4.719107151031494, -6.003857135772705], "logp_the": [-0.006902066525071859, -0.008963230066001415, -0.0024723222013562918]}
