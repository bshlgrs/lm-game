That\u2019s no typo \u2014 to get the output to rotate only once would require over 11 million rotations of the input shaft. Why? He\u2019s not sure; he wants that to be your job.\n\nOrigins\n\nWith the normal (\u201cspur\u201d) gears we all think of for basic gears, changing the speed of a shaft is space intensive. For example, to change the speed by 5x one gear must be five times the diameter of the other. This is okay for small reductions but is cumbersome for larger ratios. For this reason, multiple stages are often implemented.\n\nThe typical way of achieving high gear reductions is to use either", "correct_token_is_a": true, "logp_a": [-1.9802768230438232, -1.0531648397445679, -0.9600924849510193, -2.7148283, -0.4270258, -0.93277586], "logp_the": [-2.42182993888855, -2.1689562797546387, -2.7984371185302734, -2.6994765, -5.192056, -7.0254374]}
