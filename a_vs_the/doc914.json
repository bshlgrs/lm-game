{"id": 914, "sentence_nb": 82, "input_str": " A newly seated state senator defends his decision to sign up for a state pension after making a campaign promise to not accept this benefit.\n\nSen. Wayne Langerholc, R-Cambria County, issued a statement, saying he signed up for the pension because he was told if he didn't he would be \"forever barred\" from participating in a 401(k)-style plan like the one the Legislature proposed offered during the last legislative session.\n\n\"After reflection on the information provided, I elected to be in the SERS system to preserve my ability to opt into a 401(k) style plan,\" Langerholc said.\n\nWHTM-TV first reported Langerholc's decision to take a state pension on Wednesday. His decision reneged on a commitment memorialized on a campaign mailer paid for by Citizens Alliance of Pennsylvania to shun this benefit.\n\nCAP, as", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-2.2220261096954346, -3.128218650817871, -3.573822498321533, -13.417687, -5.9777155, -2.8729248], "logp_the": [-1.7902729511260986, -2.0625600814819336, -0.981758713722229, -0.7376483, -0.35089222, -0.92688495]}
