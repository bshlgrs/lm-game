The black rocks look red because there is smoldering lava seeping out of them. It should be noted the setting isn\u2019t like Mustafar from Revenge of the Sith with free-flowing lava. This is why early reports described it as \u201cMars with snow on it.\u201d The lava is seeping out of the giant rock formations found scattered around the salt flat valleys in between the hot rocky terrain. It still isn\u2019t clear if the white ground is salt or a light dusting of snow, but the white powdery substance collects around the banks of the settlement there and depending on who you talk to it\u2019s snow or salt.\n\nWhat is significant about", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-3.6392698287963867, -5.239993095397949, -5.734147071838379, -22.010601, -10.544351, -9.276797], "logp_the": [-1.2232637405395508, -1.1196396350860596, -1.0110101699829102, -9.80605, -2.458536, -1.5809783]}
