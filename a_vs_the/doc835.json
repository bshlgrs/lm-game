{"id": 835, "sentence_nb": 75, "input_str": " Abstract The detrimental effect of neuronal cell death due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The Indian herb Bacopa monnieri is a dietary antioxidant, with animal and in vitro studies indicating several modes of action that may protect the brain against oxidative damage. In parallel, several studies using the CDRI08 extract have shown that extracts of Bacopa monnieri improve cognitive function in humans. The biological mechanisms of this cognitive enhancement are unknown. In this review we discuss the animal studies and in vivo evidence for Bacopa monnieri as", "correct_token_is_a": true, "logp_a": [-1.4812750816345215, -0.6950170397758484, -0.5813643932342529, -0.041294202, -0.21917796, -0.35311455], "logp_the": [-2.2250266075134277, -3.858682870864868, -6.173794746398926, -20.479076, -10.111343, -13.951783]}
