{"id": 399, "sentence_nb": 34, "input_str": " Drugs and agrichemicals can be easily improved using the new process and pharma is already making use of it\n\nInserting fluorine atoms directly and simply into various organic substrates including heteroaromatic rings is now possible thanks to a user-friendly and scaleable difluoromethylation process developed by US researchers. The find opens the way for adding difluoromethyl (CF 2 H) groups to drugs and agrochemicals in order to enhance their properties.\n\nMany new life science products, including drugs and agrichemicals, contain fluorine atoms or trifluoromethyl (CF 3 ) groups because the fluorine atom can increase the metabolic stability and efficiency of bioactive compounds. For example, the CF 3 group in prozac allows the drug to be transported across", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-1.5003149509429932, -1.495814323425293, -3.0535426139831543], "logp_the": [-0.252392053604126, -0.25368785858154297, -0.04834133759140968]}
