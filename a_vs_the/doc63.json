It is an island dweller mainly, found on places like the Three Kings and the Hen and Chicken Islands, but can also be found in a coastal few places in the North Island. To ensure the dispersal of its seeds, the seedpods are encased in a sticky coating which glue themselves to the feathers of passing seabirds.\n\nThe parapara has become the garden enemy of bird-lovers, due to its ability to capture small (and sometimes quite large) birds who get too close and come to a sticky end.", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-1.8056490421295166, -1.6042571067810059, -2.3282220363616943], "logp_the": [-0.1795666515827179, -0.22444294393062592, -0.10255210846662521]}
