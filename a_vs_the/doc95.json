{"id": 95, "sentence_nb": 9, "input_str": " A new type of semiconductor laser that can be easily modified to create light over a range of different colours has been created by researchers in the US. The device is based on tiny particles called colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) that emit different colours of light according to their size \u2013 rather than their chemical composition.\n\nSemiconductor lasers are found in a wide range of technologies, from DVD players to optical communications networks. While they are efficient and inexpensive to produce, their colour is defined by the electronic band gap of the semiconductor, which means that for every colour a different set of materials and structures is required. Integrating lasers of different colours into the same electronic device can therefore be very difficult.\n\nWhat Arto Nurmikko and colleagues at Brown University in the US have managed to do is create", "correct_token_is_a": true, "logp_a": [-1.4195482730865479, -0.5922948718070984, -0.6257908344268799, -0.003102723, -0.02468409, -0.011750589], "logp_the": [-4.422178268432617, -3.0452139377593994, -3.5815632343292236, -15.153479, -8.803506, -9.16192]}
