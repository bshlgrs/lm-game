He\u2019s about 14 years old, and I\u2019ve had him since he was a pup. In fact, one of his first duties was to ride shotgun with me while I tinted windows on the weekends. He became somewhat of a local celebrity with many of the referral customers because when I showed up with Scout they would tell me I was recommended by a friend who told them I would arrive in a Jeep Wrangler with a miniature Australian Shepherd. He loves to go and he doesn\u2019t care where.\n\nHe", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-0.17068690061569214, -0.17617878317832947, -0.21160800755023956], "logp_the": [-1.8520538806915283, -1.8230522871017456, -1.6569586992263794]}
