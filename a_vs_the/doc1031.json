Last week marked 20 years since Freak Show was released and debuted No.1 on the ARIA charts. In the grand scheme of Silverchair\u2019s celebrated five-album career their sophomore record is often relegated to ugly-duckling status. It didn\u2019t have the era-defining hits of Frogstomp like Tomorrow and Pure Massacre, the emotional depth of Neon Ballroom, the musical reinvention of Diorama or the quirky originality of Young Modern. However, for many Chair fans the tortured anger of Freak Show remains a treasured edition in the catalogue of Newcastle\u2019s finest musical export.
