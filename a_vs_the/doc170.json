{"id": 170, "sentence_nb": 14, "input_str": "[BEGIN] Old dogs. There is something to love about an old dog who asks nothing from you other than to be a part of your life. Scout is a part of my life. He\u2019s about 14 years old, and I\u2019ve had him since he was a pup. In fact, one of his first duties was to ride shotgun with me while I tinted windows on the weekends. He became somewhat of a local celebrity with many of the referral customers because when I showed up with Scout they would tell me I was recommended by a friend who told them I would arrive in a Jeep Wrangler with a miniature Australian Shepherd. He loves to go and he doesn\u2019t care where.\n\nHe is the kind of dog you can only hope to have.", "correct_token_is_a": true, "logp_a": [-0.11093130707740784, -0.09503337740898132, -0.13218578696250916], "logp_the": [-2.2537975311279297, -2.4006669521331787, -2.088911771774292]}
