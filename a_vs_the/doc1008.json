He wanted to leave a parting gift to the woman he loved. He made a statue of himself that is so life-like and realistic, people couldn't tell which was the fake even while the real Masakichi stood next to it. Working with adjustable mirrors, Masakichi made each body part separately using strips of dark wood. Records differ on the number of strips used but it is between 2,000 and 5,000. The statue is mostly hollow inside.
