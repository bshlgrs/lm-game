You tell me:\n\n\n\nThree Democratic congressmen \u2014 all black \u2014 say they heard racial slurs as they walked through thousands of angry protesters outside the U.S. Capitol. A white lawmaker says he heard the epithets too. Conservative activists say the lawmakers are lying.\n\n\n\nWhat does the video show? Not much. Indeed, new interviews show that a much-viewed YouTube recording cited as evidence by conservatives was actually shot well after the time in question.\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nA reconstruction of the events shows that the conservative challenges largely sprang from a mislabeled video that was shot later in the day.\n\n\n\nBreitbart posted two columns on his Web site saying", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-2.624743700027466, -3.0969011783599854, -3.2229201793670654], "logp_the": [-0.07521755993366241, -0.04624192789196968, -0.04065382853150368]}
