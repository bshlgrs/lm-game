{"id": 742, "sentence_nb": 67, "input_str": " The anxious expectation that nothing will happen, that capitalism will go on indefinitely, the desperate demand to do something, to revolutionize capitalism, is a fake. The will to revolutionary change emerges as an urge, as an \"I cannot do it otherwise,\" or it is worthless. With regard to Bernard Williams's distinction between Ought and Must, an authentic revolution is by definition performed as a Must - it is not something we \"ought to do\" as an ideal we are striving for, but something we cannot but to, since we cannot do it otherwise. Which is why today's worry of the Leftists that revolution will not occur, that global capitalism will just go on indefinitely, is false insofar as it turns revolution into a moral obligation, into something we ought to do while we fight the inertia of the capitalist present.\n\n\n\nHowever,", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-3.8268144130706787, -4.109975337982178, -4.355436325073242, -10.151819, -4.14405, -3.5708563], "logp_the": [-1.9262683391571045, -1.9669243097305298, -2.1130199432373047, -6.216857, -1.5220745, -1.6490227]}
