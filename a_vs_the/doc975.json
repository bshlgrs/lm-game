{"id": 975, "sentence_nb": 85, "input_str": "[BEGIN] After reading through all of the wonderful feedback on Ace Day and doing a bit more research, I am happy to announce that the Revised Ace Day will take place on November 26, 2015, which is also International Cake Day (which seems appropriate for the ace community).\n\nIt is my hope that this date will be the set-in-stone date for the annual event. I have searched through Tumblr and Google and I see no other communities that have events planned for this day outside of Thanksgiving in the US, and I have a plan to accommodate those participants who will be offline that day.\n\nI\u2019m sure that this second attempt will still have a few kinks to work out, but I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s significantly smoother than the one in May was. I\u2019m releasing this announcement now so as to have plenty of time for everyone to see it and plan to participate if they wish.\n\nSo, here\u2019", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-1.170426368713379, -1.0735934972763062, -1.5439077615737915], "logp_the": [-0.3714037537574768, -0.41821327805519104, -0.24021971225738525]}
