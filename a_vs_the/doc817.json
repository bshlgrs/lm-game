{"id": 817, "sentence_nb": 73, "input_str": " Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains.[1] Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume of", "correct_token_is_a": true, "logp_a": [-2.6845245361328125, -0.48595184087753296, -0.48388296365737915, -0.094389535, -0.023063434, -0.039168954], "logp_the": [-1.0412273406982422, -2.9178709983825684, -3.0798912048339844, -6.624149, -7.3224816, -7.972867]}
