{"id": 295, "sentence_nb": 25, "input_str": " Zachary Orr\u2019s short lived NFL career will probably go unnoticed by many fans that aren\u2019t connected with the Baltimore Ravens. Which is unfortunate, because he was on his way to being a star before an early retirement. Orr was an undrafted linebacker from North Texas who started one season for Baltimore. During that one season, though, Ravens fans fell hard for this future stud.\n\nHe finishes his career with 162 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble, 2 fumble recoveries, and 3 interceptions. Of those career stats, all but 30 tackles and his lone sack came during the 2016 season.\n\nBefore", "correct_token_is_a": false, "logp_a": [-3.7415690422058105, -5.257800102233887, -5.354069709777832, -8.941268, -6.4450917, -8.160001], "logp_the": [-1.5645956993103027, -1.8967618942260742, -2.4936492443084717, -1.743802, -5.3879857, -1.8344274]}
