All lines had been engineered so that at a certain temperature, around 80 degrees, a chemical change would make specific neurons fire. In each line the neurons were different. The researchers used automated video recordings and analysis software, developed by another of the paper\u2019s authors, Pietro Perona, an engineering professor at Caltech, to determine the level of aggressive behavior", "correct_token_str": " that", "generated_token_str": " by", "generator_index": 1, "correct_logprobs": [-3.7991700172424316, -2.643843173980713, -3.0991640090942383], "generated_logprobs": [-3.988523006439209, -3.1546998023986816, -2.8959245681762695], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
