That post presented a simple denotational semantics of future values as time/value pairs. With a little care in the definition of Time (using the Max monoid), the instances of Functor, Applicative, Monad are all derived automatically.\n\nA follow-up post gave an implementation of Future values via multi threading. Unfortunately, that implementation did not necessarily satisfy the semantics", "correct_token_str": ",", "generated_token_str": " of", "generator_name": "text-curie-001", "correct_logprobs": [-7.6066113, -6.6991477, -4.5266795], "generated_logprobs": [-1.2400298, -0.6714207, -0.2787568]}
