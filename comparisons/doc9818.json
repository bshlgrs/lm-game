In colder countries it may be synonymous with ice swimming, when the water is frozen over. This requires either breaking the ice or entering where a spring prevents the formation of ice. It may also be simulated by a pool of water at 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), the temperature at which water freezes.\n\nIn Eastern", "correct_token_str": " Europe", "generated_token_str": " Finland", "generator_index": 1, "correct_logprobs": [-1.8784122467041016, -0.34082281589508057, -0.2676079571247101], "generated_logprobs": [-0.8180598616600037, -2.7250161170959473, -2.880506753921509], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
