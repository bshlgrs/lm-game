Like many of his poems, it seems simple, but it is not exactly straightforward, and even perceptive readers have disagreed considerably over its best interpretation. It looks like a personal poem about a decision of vast importance, but there is evidence to the contrary both inside and outside the poem. Frost has created a richly mysterious reading experience out of a marvelous economy of means.\n\n", "correct_token_str": "The", "generated_token_str": "\n", "generator_name": "text-babbage-001", "correct_logprobs": [-1.1833314, -0.7307467, -0.25647485], "generated_logprobs": [-0.00054649834, -0.02801675, -0.03872201]}
