{"id": 3181, "input_str": " Conclusion Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality and the nadir of the curve was observed at BMI 23-24 among never smokers, 22-23 among healthy never smokers, and 20-22 with longer durations of follow-up. The increased risk of mortality observed in underweight people could at least partly be caused by residual confounding from prediagnostic disease. Lack of exclusion of ever smokers, people with prevalent and preclinical disease, and early follow-up could bias the results", "correct_token_str": " towards", "generated_token_str": ",", "generator_index": 2, "correct_logprobs": [-9.446813583374023, -4.79937219619751, -1.9276264905929565], "generated_logprobs": [-3.687258243560791, -2.8335747718811035, -3.0514822006225586], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
