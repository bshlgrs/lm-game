{"id": 8537, "input_str": " A key challenge in developing artificial intelligence systems with the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition is giving them a similar ability - to reason about entities and their relations from unstructured data. Solving this would allow these systems to generalize to new combinations of entities, making infinite use of finite means.\n\nModern deep learning methods have made tremendous progress solving problems from unstructured data, but they tend to do so without explicitly considering the relations between objects.\n\nIn two new papers, we explore the ability for deep neural networks to", "correct_token_str": " perform", "generated_token_str": " create", "generator_index": 0, "correct_logprobs": [-4.7882184982299805, -4.324716567993164, -3.9038684368133545], "generated_logprobs": [-3.5938374996185303, -5.833581924438477, -6.127272605895996], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
