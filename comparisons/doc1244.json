{"id": 1993, "input_str": " A comet strike may have triggered the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a rapid warming of Earth caused by an accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide 56 million years ago, which offers analogs to global warming today. Sorting through samples of sediment from the time period, researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute discovered evidence of the strike in the form of microtektites -- tiny dark glassy spheres typically formed by extraterrestrial impacts. The research will be published in the journal", "correct_token_str": " Science", "generated_token_str": " Ge", "generator_name": "text-curie-001", "correct_logprobs": [-4.267855, -2.4728892, -2.96901], "generated_logprobs": [-5.940283, -1.6646721, -0.601773]}
