It was created to make it easy to run and iterate on sophisticated experiments in a statistically sound manner while satisfying the constraints of deployed Internet services.\n\nDevelopers implement experiments using PlanOut by providing a high-level specification for how units (e.g., users, cookie IDs) should be mapped to parameters that control the user experience.
