{"id": 460, "input_str": " A modular rocket is a type of multistage rocket which features components that can be interchanged for specific mission requirements. Several such rockets use similar concepts such as unified modules to minimize expenses on manufacturing, transportation and for optimization of support infrastructure for flight preparations.\n\nThe National Launch System study (1991-1992) looked at future launchers in a modular (cluster) fashion.
