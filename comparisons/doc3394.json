{"id": 3394, "input_str": " Ice sheets lose mass through melting (surface or basal) and dynamic changes (for example, the acceleration and retreat of outlet glaciers). For the Greenland ice sheet, these two components have made approximately equal contributions to its recent negative mass balance12. In Antarctica, surface melt is much less important, but the West Antarctic ice sheet is thought to be vulnerable to oceanic warming because large parts of its bed lie below sea level13. Recent estimates have also confirmed its negative mass", "correct_token_str": " balance", "generated_token_str": " inequality", "generator_index": 0, "correct_logprobs": [-2.3898091316223145, -0.0568343885242939, -0.014293784275650978], "generated_logprobs": [-8.823873519897461, -12.151347160339355, -12.957050323486328], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
