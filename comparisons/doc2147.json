{"id": 3445, "input_str": " Laser cooling refers to a number of techniques in which atomic and molecular samples are cooled down to near absolute zero. Laser cooling techniques rely on the fact that when an object (usually an atom) absorbs and re-emits a photon (a particle of light) its momentum changes. For an ensemble of particles, their temperature is proportional to the", "correct_token_str": " variance", "generated_token_str": " product", "generator_name": "text-babbage-001", "correct_logprobs": [-12.129306, -10.522365, -7.397436], "generated_logprobs": [-3.9495666, -1.4460093, -4.3354278]}
