{"id": 4684, "input_str": " New York City is undeniably large. The most populous city in the United States has nearly 8.5 million people. But it is nowhere near as big as Tokyo and yet the Big Apple has far more homeless than Tokyo.\n\nThe numbers are eye opening: Tokyo has 13.4 million residents, but only 1,697 are homeless. Compare that to New York, where there are 56,000 homeless. The homelessness rate there is 67 per 10,000 residents, while it\u2019s only 1 per 10,000 in Tokyo.\n\nScott Keyes at Think", "correct_token_str": "Progress", "generated_token_str": "wing", "generator_index": 0, "correct_logprobs": [-2.1031463146209717, -0.28774699568748474, -0.5816079378128052], "generated_logprobs": [-8.597533226013184, -17.646556854248047, -15.060592651367188], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
