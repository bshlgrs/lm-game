{"id": 7181, "input_str": " A nagging lack of evidence for weakly interacting massive particles has spurred physicists to start searching for a range of lightweight dark particles and even new dark forces.\n\nIn 2015 a team of nuclear physicists in Hungary reported an anomalous bump in the signal from radioactive decays of unstable beryllium-8, corresponding to a putative new particle with 34 times the mass of an electron (1). It was largely overlooked at the time, but a year later US theorists suggested that this might point to a new force felt by dark matter,", "correct_token_str": " hint", "generated_token_str": " but", "generator_index": 0, "correct_logprobs": [-8.963236808776855, -6.676296234130859, -6.6244893074035645], "generated_logprobs": [-1.5003551244735718, -4.892162322998047, -4.944382190704346], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
