{"id": 3141, "input_str": " The hormone insulin is released in distinct pulses from the \u03b2-cells of the pancreatic islets in response to elevated blood glucose levels, and disturbed pulsatile insulin secretion is a hallmark of the metabolic disease diabetes. Electrical coupling between \u03b2-cells leads to excitation waves, which have been proposed to provide the synchronizing signal that propagates the glucose-evoked response across the islet. Surprisingly, recent studies showed that the \u03b2-cells", "correct_token_str": " within", "generated_token_str": " was", "generator_index": 0, "correct_logprobs": [-7.638760089874268, -5.502792835235596, -6.370858669281006], "generated_logprobs": [-3.617872714996338, -8.491500854492188, -10.046372413635254], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
