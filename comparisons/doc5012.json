The server does not need to know anything about the clients trying to connect. Simply put, this is a proxy server that works behind a NAT, even when the client is behind a different NAT, without any 3rd party or network changes.", "correct_token_str": " There", "generated_token_str": " The", "generator_index": 2, "correct_logprobs": [-4.353856086730957, -5.256656646728516, -5.2822089195251465], "generated_logprobs": [-1.8114500045776367, -3.1347086429595947, -3.0123798847198486], "generator_names": ["gelu_two_layers/", "gelu_twelve_layers/", "gelu_twenty_four_layers/"]}
