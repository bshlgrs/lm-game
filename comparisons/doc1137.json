{"id": 1824, "input_str": " Male strippers, as it turns out, are much less easy to find than their female counterparts. I tried to find a male strip club in Los Angeles last week, but was initially unsuccessful. You can see strippers who are women any hour of the day, during breakfast or in the middle of the night, but male strippers are by-appointment-only. You have to either order one directly to your home or find a scheduled revue. Los Angeles has a handful of revues at clubs on Friday and Saturday nights.", "correct_token_str": " I", "generated_token_str": " There", "generator_name": "text-babbage-001", "correct_logprobs": [-4.0138545, -5.595177, -2.712425], "generated_logprobs": [-4.8577557, -5.4244847, -5.335981]}
